# Portfolio

A React application to showcase the portfolio that I built and contributed to.

## Built With

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - Javascript runtime
* [React](https://reactjs.org/) - Javascript library for UI
* [Create-React-App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) - React App boiler plate
* [Semantic UI React](https://react.semantic-ui.com/) - Semantic UI React integration


## Starting the app locally

Start by installing front and backend dependencies. While in this directory, run the following command:

```
npm i
```

This should install node modules within the server and the client folder.

After both installations complete, run the following command in your terminal:

```
npm start
```

Your app should now be running on <http://localhost:3000>. The Express server should intercept any AJAX requests from the client.

## Deployment (Netlify)

This application is deployed via Netlify

See deployed version [here](https://secure-reef-41974.herokuapp.com/)

To deploy, simply add and commit your changes, and push. As is, Netlify should take care of the rest.

See Netlify continuous deployment documentation [here](https://www.netlify.com/docs/continuous-deployment/)
